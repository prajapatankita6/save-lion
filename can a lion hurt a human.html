    <h2>Ans.</h2><p>YES. a lion can hurt a human being .
         As a large, apex predator that hunts animals weighing up to 1,000 pounds, 
         a lion is more than capable of having a human for lunch. And they do.
        Lions kill between 20 and 250 people each year worldwide.
         Tanzania has the largest population of lions in Africa.</p>
